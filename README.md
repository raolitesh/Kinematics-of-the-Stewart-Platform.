This project explores two numerical methods of finding roots $(x)$ of non-linear equations which satisfy the
equation $f(x) = 0$. We use Bisection and Newton-Raphson methods to find roots of the given equation , and we
state reasons why we prefer one method over another. We also discuss briefly, why we are not using Fixed-point
iteration method to solve the given problem. This project uses the non-linear equations derived for Stewart
Platform titled as Kinematics of the Stewart Platform presented in Chapter 1 of the book by Timothy Sauer,
3rd edition. We see that we can get approximate roots with fewer iterations if we are able to plot the function
and find the intervals containing true roots.
